With this tool site, you are able to quickly jump to various Online Judge sites that are used in competitive programming. The site is built with base [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), with its repo being hosted on GitHub. You can visit the site [here](https://oi-jumper.eoin.blog).

It's also worth noting that this site is more of a practice project than a fully competent webapp. I learned to code webpages using Tailwind CSS and the CSS flexbox environment during the development of this site. If you also happen to be a greenhand in web development or don't know you way around flexbox, I highly recommend checking out [the flexbox tutorial by Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/).
